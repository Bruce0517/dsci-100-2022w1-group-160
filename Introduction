#The Meaningful HTRU2
**Introduction**:Pulsars are extremely rare neutron stars that can generate radio waves by themselves and serve as detectors of space-time, 
the interstellar medium, and the state of matter. These radiation data were observed by scientists on Earth. 
As they have considerable scientific significance.The predictors that we are interested are listed below:
p.mean: The mean value of pulsar
p.sd: The stardard division of pulsar 
p.kurt:The kurtosis value of pulsar
p.skew:The skewness value of pulsar
c.mean
c.sd
c.kurt
c.skew
class
**Method**:In order to make the data more convincing, we first make our selection random and fixed by setting a sample, 
considering that the samples that mark pulsar candidates have a binary relationship. 
We will distinguish the data of class = 0 and class = 1, the difference in mean, sd, skew, etc., 
and visualize the data more intuitively and readable by means of histogram.The histogram graphs can significantly help us to obeserve the different
values tendency and the difference between pulsar and non-pulsar.
**Expected outcomes**
